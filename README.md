Development of a technical help for San Rafael Special Education School students (15): Transition to Adult Life – Races Game.

ABSTRACT:

This Project exposed here is part of the collaboration between the Special Education School of the Hospital San Rafael in Madrid for children with cognitive and motor disability and the Displays and Photonics Applications Group of the Carlos III University of Madrid (GDAF-UC3M).

The aim of the project is the implementation of a races game adapted for pupils with disabilities of the Special Education School and help them in their Transition to Adult Life.

In order to achieve a global visión of the project “Development of a technical help for San Rafael Special Education School students (15): Transition to Adult Life – Races Game.”. It is mandatory to read it jointly with Sergio Aguilera Sevilla’s project. The work load is divided between these two documents. The present document describes the development of the Rails Block and the design of the printed circuit boards of both Rails Block and Ramp Block. Sergio Aguilera Sevilla’s project describes the development of the Ramp Block and the construction process of the chasis of both Rails Block and Ramp Block.

Communication between the two blocks is possible because of the implementation of a radiofrequency line. The data flow is unidirectional, and all the stream is from Ramp Block to Rails Block.

Rails Block is composed by four “conveyer belts” moved by four stepper motors, these motors are commanded by a microcontroller which receives the orders from other microcontroller placed in the Ramp Block.

Ramp Block sends instructions to Rails Block depending on in which phase the game is. These orders can be related to move one of the stepper motors a specific distance, or maybe related to indicate how many players it will be on that match. During the duration of the game, there is always an auditory scanning of what is going on each time.

The game has been proven and tested in the school and at this very moment it is placed there, operating perfectly.
